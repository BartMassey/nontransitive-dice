# Nontransitive Dice Simulation
Copyright Â© 2015 Bart Massey

[Nontransitive Dice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontransitive_dice)
are interesting objects. This simulation of die rolls is
written in Haskell for clarity (?) and verifiability. The
source code is thoroughly commented.

To try the simulation, just say "`runghc dice.hs 10000`".
The simulation will run 10000 times. The output shows the
number of runs in which the first die won the roll-off, the
number of runs, and the percentage of first-die wins.
